# Contributing to React-Onus

First off, thank you for considering contributing to react-onus. It's people like you that make react-onus such a great library.

## Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Detail your suggestion in an issue. Explain the use case and why it would be useful to most react-onus users. Don't just tell what you want, but explain why.

- Provide a clear use case. Your use case should be one that is beneficial to the wider community, not just something that you'd find useful.
  Pull Requests

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

- Update the README.md with details of changes to the library, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.

- Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.

### Development Environment

Given the nature of react-onus being a library with a paired test website, it is crucial to ensure that any changes made in the library do not break features in the test site. Ensure you run and test any changes in both environments.

### Writing Tests

Where possible, please provide tests for the changes you're making. This is crucial for bug fixes and new features.

### Code Style

Adhere to the existing coding style as much as possible. If in doubt, refer to popular style guides or the existing codebase.

### Getting Your Pull Request Merged

All Pull Requests are subject to approval by the repository maintainers. While not all Pull Requests may be merged, all are appreciated and will be reviewed quickly.

### Community

Keep all communication public. The community is valuable and public communication ensures that everyone can benefit from conversations, questions, and critiques.
